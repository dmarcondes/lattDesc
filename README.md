## lattDesc: Lattice descent algorithms for learning in Boolean lattices

Python package `lattDesc` provides implementations of stochastic lattice descent algorithms  in `numpy` for learning in Boolean lattices. It has the modules `learning`, `data` and `utils` with learning algorithms, data processing functions and utility functions. Refer to `lattDesc` [documentation](https://raw.githack.com/dmarcondes/lattDesc/master/docs/lattDesc.html) for more details.
